# 🎬 Project_Invest_Movies_Data

## 📌 Project Overview  
**Project_Invest_Movies_Data** is a data exploration project focused on analyzing a movie dataset (`tmdb-movies.csv`).  
The goal is to clean, explore, visualize and understand the structure of movie-related data, uncover potential patterns, and generate insights about trends such as popularity, genres, ratings, and release years.

This project was created as part of a data analysis learning path and demonstrates full **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow.

## 📂 Repository Contents  
- **`tmdb-movies.csv`** — the raw dataset used for analysis  
- **`Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb`** — the main Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations  
- **`Investigate_a_Dataset.html`** — exported HTML version of the notebook  
- **`requirements.txt`** — a list of Python dependencies  
- **`.gitignore`** — ignored files configuration  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals  
The analysis focuses on answering questions such as:

- What variables correlate with movie popularity?  
- How do different genres perform in terms of ratings and popularity?  
- Are there noticeable trends over time in movie production or audience engagement?  
- What characteristics (runtime, release year, genre, vote_average) define successful movies?  

The project aims to turn raw data into understandable insights through visualization and analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
This project uses a standard data science stack:

### **Languages & Core Tools**
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### **Libraries**
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

(Additional plotting or utility libraries may be included depending on `requirements.txt`.)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrzemekJedruch/Project_Invest_Movies_Data.git
```
### 2. Install dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb


Now you can explore the dataset, rerun the analysis, or extend it with your own insights.

## 📈 Future Improvements

Here are potential extensions to the project:

Adding more external datasets (revenue, reviews, budget, cast data, etc.)

Building an interactive dashboard (Streamlit, Dash, Plotly)

Implementing predictive models to estimate movie success

Deeper time-series analysis of movie trends

Clustering movies based on similarities in features

## ℹ️ Notes

This project is intended for educational and exploratory purposes.
The goal is to practice real-world data analysis techniques: cleaning, wrangling, exploring, visualizing, and drawing conclusions from data.
