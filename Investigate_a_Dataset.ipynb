    "The dataset used for this analysis is the TMDb (The Movie Database) movies dataset. This dataset contains information about movies, including various attributes such as budget, revenue, cast, crew, and more. Below is a brief description of the columns in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id**: Unique identifier for each movie.\n",
    "- **imdb_id**: IMDB identifier for each movie.\n",
    "- **popularity**: Popularity score of the movie.\n",

    "- **revenue**: Revenue of the movie in dollars.\n",
    "- **original_title**: Original title of the movie.\n",
    "- **cast**: Main cast of the movie.\n",
    "- **homepage**: Homepage URL of the movie.\n",
    "- **director**: Director of the movie.\n",
    "- **tagline**: Tagline of the movie.\n",
    "- **keywords**: Keywords associated with the movie.\n",
    "- **overview**: Brief description of the movie.\n",
    "- **runtime**: Runtime of the movie in minutes.\n",
    "- **genres**: Genres of the movie.\n",
    "- **production_companies**: Production companies involved in the movie.\n",
    "- **release_date**: Release date of the movie.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **What is the relationship between the budget and revenue of movies?**\n",
    "   - **Dependent Variable**: Revenue\n",
    "   - **Independent Variables**: Budget, Popularity, Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does the release date impact the popularity of movies?**\n",
    "   - **Dependent Variable**: Popularity\n",
    "   - **Independent Variables**: Release Date, Genres, Vote Count\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Which genres tend to have higher average ratings?**\n",
    "   - **Dependent Variable**: Vote Average\n",
    "   - **Independent Variables**: Genres, Director, Cast\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Which genres are most popular from year to year?**\n",
    "   - **Dependent Variable**: Popularity\n",
    "   - **Independent Variables**: Release Year, Genres\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?**\n",

    "> **Tip**: Once you start coding, use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names."

    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will load the dataset and perform data cleaning steps to prepare it for analysis. We will perform exploratory data analysis to investigate the research questions posed in the introduction. We will compute statistics and create visualizations to explore the relationships and patterns in the dataset.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, you will load in the data, check for cleanliness, and then trim and clean your dataset for analysis. Make sure that you **document your data cleaning steps in mark-down cells precisely and justify your cleaning decisions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Properties\n",
    "> **Tip**: You should _not_ perform too many operations in each cell. Create cells freely to explore your data. One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations initially. This does not have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types, and filtering the data.\n",
    "We will perform the following data cleaning steps:\n",
    "1. **Drop unnecessary columns**: We remove columns that we don't need for our analysis to make our dataset smaller and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Drop duplicate rows**: We remove any repeated rows to ensure each movie is only listed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle missing values**: We fill in or remove missing data to avoid errors in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convert data types**: We change the format of some columns to the correct type (like dates and numbers) so we can use them properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Filter out zero values**: We remove rows where the budget or revenue is zero because they don't provide useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extract release year**: We create a new column for the release year from the release date to make it easier to analyze movies by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Split columns into separate rows**: We split columns like genres and cast into separate rows to analyze each genre and cast member individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Create adjusted budget and revenue**: We add new columns for budget and revenue adjusted for inflation to compare movies from different years fairly.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Remove zero values in adjusted columns**: We remove rows where the adjusted budget or revenue is zero for the same reason as step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Filter movies released after 2000**: We only keep movies released after the year 2000 to focus our analysis on more recent films.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Check the final shape**: We check the size and structure of our cleaned dataset to ensure everything looks correct.\n",

    "> **Tip**: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. **Compute statistics** and **create visualizations** with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. Note that at least two or more kinds of plots should be created as part of the exploration, and you must  compare and show trends in the varied visualizations. Remember to utilize the visualizations that the pandas library already has available.\n",

    "> **Tip**: Investigate the stated question(s) from multiple angles. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables. You should explore at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n",
